<p>1. If the customer is yelling, take a deep breath.
<br>
2. Empathize with the customer. Make them feel heard.
<br>
3. Let them know that we take complaints very seriously. Feel free to offer replacement candy for the ones that were unsatisfactory. For the unsatisfactory candy, simply apply this discount in the order management system: "complaintDiscount" 
<br>
4. If there are further issues, you can schedule a callback with a supervisor. To do this, click the Complaint callback button on your script in Genesys Cloud CX. Be sure to leave notes about the complaint and then message your supervisor that you just submitted a callback complaint.
